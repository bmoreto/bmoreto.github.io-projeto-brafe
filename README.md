# ☕ Brafé Project

A website developed during the **Advanced CSS – Positioning Course** by [Origamid](https://www.origamid.com/).  
This course focused on mastering the **fundamentals of element positioning** in web layouts, exploring how each CSS property affects the structure and flow of a page.

## 🚀 About the Course

The course covered the complete process of understanding and applying CSS positioning — starting from the most basic concepts and moving toward more complex layouts.

The main goal was to learn how to position and organize elements on a web page **from the ground up**, without relying on frameworks or shortcuts.  
The lessons emphasized how properties like `position`, `float`, `display`, `width`, `height`, and `z-index` interact to define a page's structure.
